# Sample Project

This is the sample_project by Matan .  
The pure intantion for this repository is educational.  

I plan on experimenting with:

- CMake
- googletest library
- github actions
- markdown documentations

## Cmake

All the source files are complied using CMake.  

## googletest

Each module under source has a matching (pretty-useless) test under test folder

## github actions

Trying to make wonder under the `.github` folder.

## markdown

Comeon! look at this beauty :)

testing for some code snippest preview

Here is a C code snippest:

```c

for(uint32_t i = 0; i < MAX_NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS; i++)
{
  if(rand() < RANDOM_THRESHOLD)
  {
    break;
  }
}
```

Here is a bash code snippest:

```bash
cd my_dir
swfw_make hello_world
```

## Cool things are ahead of you
